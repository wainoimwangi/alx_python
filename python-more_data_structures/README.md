# Python data structures

In Python, there are several built-in data structures that allow you to organize and store data efficiently. 

## Exampes of data structures

# Lists:
Lists are ordered collections that can store elements of different data types. They are mutable, meaning you can modify their contents after creation. Lists are denoted by square brackets [].
# Tuples:
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed after creation. They are denoted by parentheses ().
# Sets:
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They do not allow duplicate values and are useful for removing duplicates from a list. Sets are denoted by curly braces {} or the set() constructor.
# Dictionaries:
Dictionaries are collections of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary maps to a corresponding value. Dictionaries are useful for quick lookups based on keys. They are denoted by curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.
