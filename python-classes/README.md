# Python object-oriented programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. OOP allows you to model real-world entities and their interactions by using classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects. Python is an object-oriented programming language, and it supports all the core OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

##  Key concepts of object-oriented programming 

- # Class: 
A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that an object of that class will have. It encapsulates the data and behavior of the objects it creates. In Python, you define a `class` using the class keyword.
- # Object: 
An object is an instance of a class, created using the class constructor. Each object has its own set of attributes and can call the methods defined in its class.
- # Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is the principle of restricting access to certain attributes or methods of a class. In Python, you can achieve this by using private attributes (prefixed with two underscores __) and getter/setter methods.
- # Inheritance: 
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It facilitates code reuse and hierarchical relationships between classes.
- # Polymorphism: 
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of a common superclass. It enables code to work with different types of objects through a common interface.
