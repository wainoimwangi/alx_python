# Python import modules

In Python, you can import modules to access their functions, classes, and variables in your code. There are different ways to import modules based on your requirements. 

## Common methods of importing modules 

- Import the entire module:
You can import the entire module and access its content using the module name.
- Import specific items from a module:
You can import specific functions, classes, or variables from a module, and then you can directly use them without using the module name.
- Import the entire module with an alias:
You can give an alias to a module to use a shorter name in your code.
- Import specific items from a module with an alias:
You can import specific items from a module with an alias.
- Import the entire module into the global namespace (not recommended):
You can import the entire module's content into the global namespace, but it's generally not recommended because it can lead to naming conflicts.
