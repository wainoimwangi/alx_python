# Python Functions

 In Python, functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called multiple times throughout the program. They help in modularizing code and making it more organized.

## Components of a Python function

-`def`: This keyword is used to define a function in Python.

-`function_name`: This is the name of the function. Choose a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the function. It should follow Python's naming conventions.

-`parameters`: These are optional input values that the function can accept. Parameters are enclosed within parentheses and can be used inside the function.

-`Function body`: This is the indented block of code that contains the instructions and logic for the function.

-`return`: This keyword is used to specify the value that the function will return after its execution. If the function does not return anything, you can omit the return statement.
