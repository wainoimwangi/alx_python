# Flask Python Web Framework

Flask is a lightweight and versatile Python web framework designed to help you build web applications quickly and with minimal overhead. It follows the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and provides tools and libraries that make it easy to create web applications with Python.

## Features

- **Minimalistic**: Flask is designed to be simple and minimal, giving you the flexibility to choose the tools and libraries you need for your specific project.

- **Micro Framework**: Flask is often referred to as a micro framework because it provides only the essentials needed to get a web application up and running. This allows developers to add features and extensions as needed.

- **Routing**: Flask allows you to define URL routes for your application, mapping URLs to specific functions that handle the requests.

- **Templates**: Flask supports Jinja2 templating, allowing you to separate your application logic from your HTML templates.

- **Extensions**: Flask has a wide range of extensions available that add extra functionality, such as handling forms, databases, authentication, and more.

- **Integrated Development Server**: Flask comes with a built-in development server that is convenient for testing and debugging during development.

- **HTTP Methods**: It supports HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., allowing you to create RESTful APIs easily.

- **Secure**: While Flask provides the tools to build secure applications, it does not impose security features by default. It's up to the developer to implement security measures.

## Installation

To get started with Flask, you'll need to have Python and `pip` (Python's package manager) installed on your system. You can install Flask using the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of a Flask application to give you an idea of how it works:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, Flask!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Save the above code in a file, say `app.py`, and run it using:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your Flask application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
